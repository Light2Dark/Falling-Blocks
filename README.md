# Falling Blocks

Hi! This is a simple falling blocks game implemented with Unity. I intend to learn this engine and use this for future game dev projects. 
Special thanks to Sebastian Lague for his tutorials.

## Installation

1) Download the FallingBlocks.apk and transfer this file to your phone.
2) Install it on your phone by opening it.
3) You may need to allow the allow external apps installation option.

## Usage

Since the game has no instructions (sry about that...).
 
Tap the left side / right side of the screen to move the player. Avoid the blocks as long as you can!
